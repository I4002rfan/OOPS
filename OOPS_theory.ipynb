        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\",\n",
        "# which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code,\n",
        "# in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "# An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that has the attributes and can perform the actions defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "# Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
        "# Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "# Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores.\n",
        "# They are used to implement and customize the behavior of objects, such as operator overloading. For example, `__init__`, `__str__`.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "# Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (child or derived class) inherits attributes and methods\n",
        "# from an existing class (parent or base class). This promotes code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "# It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "# Encapsulation in Python is achieved by making the attributes private (using a single underscore `_` or double underscore `__` prefix)\n",
        "# and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "# A constructor is a special method in a class, named `__init__`, that is automatically called when a new object of the class is created.\n",
        "# It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "# A class method is bound to the class and not the object. It is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and takes the class as its first argument (usually named `cls`).\n",
        "# A static method is not bound to the class or the object. It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and doesn't have any implicit first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "# Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
        "# However, similar functionality can be achieved by using default arguments or variable-length argument lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "# Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method\n",
        "# that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "# The `@property` decorator is used to define methods that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "# It allows for the implementation of getters, setters, and deleters for a \"private\" attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism is important because it allows for writing more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "# It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "# An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It is designed to be subclassed,\n",
        "# and it often contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but contain no implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "# The advantages of OOP include modularity, reusability, productivity, easier troubleshooting, and security through encapsulation and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "# A class variable is shared by all instances of a class. An instance variable is unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "# Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "# `__str__` is used to return an informal, human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "# `__repr__` is used to return an official, unambiguous string representation of an object, which can often be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "# The `super()` function is used to call a method from a parent class. It is often used in the `__init__` method of a subclass\n",
        "# to call the constructor of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "# The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "# It can be used to perform cleanup tasks, such as closing file handles or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        "# `@staticmethod` does not receive an implicit first argument. `@classmethod` receives the class as the implicit first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "# In Python, a subclass can override a method of its superclass. When a method is called on an object,\n",
        "# Python determines which version of the method to execute at runtime based on the object's type.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "# Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code.\n",
        "# This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (`self`).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "# The `__call__` method allows an object to be called as a function.\n",
        "# If a class defines `__call__`, then instances of that class can be invoked with parentheses."
